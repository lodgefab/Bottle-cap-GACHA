### Why we made this?
Collecting plastic waste is boring. Since we run a community to make keyboards out of wasted bottle caps[(check out #ANYCAP](https://anycap.xyz/)), we know how hard and boring it is to collect waste plastic. In order to make recycling playful, we made a capsule toy machine ('Gachapon' in Japanese) that people can challenge with bottle caps instead of coins. The machine is made from MDF & Acrylic board. So you can make it easily at your local fab space.
